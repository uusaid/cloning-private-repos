# saving this here as a public repo so that i can access this even if i lose access to my account
# also useful with public repos cuz passwords dont work anymore

for private repos, instead of the traditional git clone <https-link>, try this:
git clone https://your-token@github.com/your-username-NOT-email/name-of-your-private-repo.git
